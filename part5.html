          <p>Vietnam widened the gulf because young people are the ones sent to war. Campuses seethed. American flags burned. The number of draft dodgers topped 200,000.</p>
					<p>Ciesielski (pronounced Sha-SHELL-ski), then 26 and convinced the war was immoral, was among those who refused to go.</p>
          <p>His biggest problem: He was already in uniform, stationed in Norfolk with the Navy.</p>
          <p>Back in high school in Milwaukee, he'd joined the Naval Reserves at 17: "At the time, it seemed like the manly thing to do. I had every intention of serving."</p>
					<p>College deferments postponed active duty for five years. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, he was exposed to the student peace movement, with all of its questions:</p>
					<p>Why was the U.S. sending troops to fight in someone else's civil war? Supporting one side that seemed as corrupt as the other? Cratering the countryside with bombs? Burning up people with napalm?</p>
					<p>It wasn't even a declared war. Washington was calling it a "conflict."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5">
					<p>By the time he was called up to active duty in June 1966, Ciesielski's anti-Vietnam convictions were deep. He wrote letters to the military - one to President Lyndon Johnson himself - stating that he was willing to serve in the Navy but unwilling to play a direct part in the war. A "selective" conscientious objector.</p>
					<p>He was assigned to the carrier Independence, based in Norfolk &ndash; a petty officer third class doing clerical work.</p>
          <p>Off base, Ciesielski found a budding peace movement. He joined in with like-minded locals &ndash; handing out anti-draft leaflets at shopping centers and schools, driving to Washington to take part in big marches.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;But I always did it on my own time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And never in uniform.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>By 1967, tensions were hair-trigger. Students across the country were holding sit-ins against Dow Chemical Company, the maker of napalm. At Norfolk&rsquo;s Old Dominion College, a demonstration turned ugly, with opposing students throwing raw eggs at the anti-war kids, tearing up their signs, calling them &ldquo;commies.&rdquo;</p>
					 <p>And Navy investigators were keeping an eye on Ciesielski. His security clearance was revoked. The carrier&rsquo;s skipper wanted him gone.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
          <p>That fall &ndash; just a few months before he was due to finish his military commitment &ndash; he received orders for the guided missile frigate Dewey, bound for Vietnam.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was a coincidence,&rdquo; Ciesielski said. &ldquo;It was an intentional move to force my hand. To make an example of me.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>On the day the Dewey was to depart, Ciesielski delivered a letter to the ship&rsquo;s commander, informing him that he wouldn&rsquo;t be coming. Then he went to the naval station&rsquo;s legal center and turned himself in. He was handcuffed and returned to the Dewey for a second chance to comply.</p>
          <p>When he refused to board, he was formally charged. The ship sailed without him.</p>
          <p>Other servicemen would do similar things, but Ciesielski was on the leading edge of an anti-war movement within the ranks. His case made national news.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I feel the United States&rsquo; role in this war is unjust,&rdquo; he told reporters.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Ciesielski is of slight build,&rdquo; read a story in The Virginian-Pilot, &ldquo;and wears his pale blond hair short. Big spectacles make him look a little owlish.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>The story said he spoke quietly about his convictions, hands twisting nervously, and was worried about how his family back in Wisconsin would take the news.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be easy on them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>Facing up to six years in prison, Ciesielski was court-martialed in April 1968 &ndash; just as the smoke was clearing from the bloody Tet Offensive in Vietnam.</p>
          <p>He was found guilty of two crimes: willfully disobeying the lawful order of a superior officer and intentionally missing his ship.</p>
          <p>He was sentenced to one year, given a bad conduct discharge and sent to a Navy prison in Portsmouth, N.H.</p>

          <p>Compared to the brig &ndash; where he&rsquo;d been put to hard labor breaking up concrete blocks &ndash; prison wasn&rsquo;t too bad. He was assigned to office work and given his own cell, like other war resisters. The Marine guards called them &ldquo;pukes,&rdquo; but were mostly civil.</p>
          <p>Letters arrived from across the country.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Some people thought I was a hero. Others called me a traitor. Believe me, it would have been a lot easier to just board the ship.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>With good behavior, he was released after nine months, handed $25, a prison-made suit and a plane ticket.</p>
          <p>Ciesielski landed back in Norfolk in January 1969, just as Rick Woolard was returning from his first tour in Vietnam.</p>

  				<h3>He'd been gone only seven months, but Woolard barely recognized the society he returned to.</p>
          <p>At age 25, he'd been leading one of the Navy's SEAL teams, which had evolved to counteract the guerilla tactics of the Viet Cong. He'd been crawling on his belly through jungles, wading through swamps and taking bullets during the deadliest year for troops in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what the guys who&rsquo;d been gone a whole year felt like,&rdquo; Woolard said. &ldquo;I mean, you&rsquo;d hear about things happening back home &ndash; moon landings and assassinations &ndash; but there was no such thing as a 24/7 news cycle. Besides, you had more pressing things to do than watch the news. No wonder a lot of vets had a sort of disassociation when they came back. Between 1967 and &rsquo;69, the damned place changed so much.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He was aware that a lot of people his age were protesting the war in demonstrations that were growing increasingly violent. Returning vets were being heckled by long-hairs in airports: &ldquo;Welcome home, baby killer.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Although he&rsquo;d come of age just a few years earlier, this felt like a different era.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I graduated from college in 1965,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our drug was beer.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Born in Texas, raised in New York, he&rsquo;d gone to Colgate University and the Naval War College, then on to Virginia Beach for underwater demolition training at Little Creek &ndash; itching to do something &ldquo;interesting and exciting.&rdquo;</p>

					<h3>DID YOU KNOW?</h3>
					<p class="captions">1968<span class="text-muted"> was the deadliest year for American troops, with over 1,000 per month killed.</span></p>
          <p class="captions">By the end of 1968, <span class="text-muted">1 of every 12 South Vietnamese was living in a refugee camp.</span></p>
          <p class="captions">A father and son <span class="text-muted">who epitomized the '60s generation gap: Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors and counterculture icon; Rear Adm. George Morrison, commander of naval forces during the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which sparked the escalation of the Vietnam War.</span></p>
					<p class="captions">The "Madman Theory" <span class="text-muted">was a primary prong in President Richard Nixon's Vietnam strategy. He wanted communist leaders to see him as an obsessed, irrational figure who might do anything - including use nuclear weapons - to win the war.</span></p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
          <p>Going to Vietnam was a given. It was his job. He&rsquo;d taken an oath, and he was satisfied that his country&rsquo;s leaders were trying to do what they thought was right: Stop the spread of communism. Save the South Vietnamese.</p>
          <p>On the ground, no one had time to ponder such things. The daily goal was simple: Kill the enemy. Don&rsquo;t get killed yourself.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not looking up very high,&rdquo; Woolard said. &ldquo;Your loyalty and concern is to the guy on your left, your right, in front and behind. And you&rsquo;ll do anything not to let them down.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>There wasn&rsquo;t much of a playbook back then. The fledgling SEALs were figuring things out as they went. Woolard worked in a marshy area outside Saigon known as the Forest of Assassins. By day, he&rsquo;d go up in a helicopter, scouting the lay of the land. By night, he and his men prowled the dark &ndash; hiding, listening, ambushing, being ambushed.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
          <p>Everyone in his platoon survived that tour, but several were wounded, including Woolard. In October 1968, he was shot in the arm and leg. Ten days later, shrapnel sliced open a shoulder. He healed and went back to work, staying in Vietnam for three more months.</p>
          <p>His second tour started in October 1969, right around the time of a mushrooming movement called Moratorium to End the War. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were marching, linking demonstrations across the country.</p>

          <p>In Norfolk, a band of students gathered on Granby Street in front of the federal building. Wearing black armbands and carrying black flags, they began reading from a list of troops killed &ndash; 44,000 by that point.</p>
          <p>The day was cold and windy. The names fell &ndash; one after the other &ndash; from 7 in the morning until 10 at night.</p>
					<p>Some parents of the dead were offended. If the U.S. quit now, would their sons have died for nothing?</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use my boy&rsquo;s name and pretend you speak for him,&rdquo; one father said.</p>
          <p>In Woolard&rsquo;s own family, relatives were taking sides.</p>
          <p>His younger sister became a &ldquo;hippie. I don&rsquo;t think she ever became a communist, but she fell in love with Russian art and literature and was very much against the war. Not against me &ndash; we loved each other &ndash; but she was very skeptical about soldiers and the military. She thought we were doing bad things in the war.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>In November 1969, news broke of the My Lai massacre. A group of U.S. soldiers on a rampage had brutalized and killed hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, including children.</p>
          <p>Woolard&rsquo;s stepfather &ndash; a patriotic guy who&rsquo;d done his own military time &ndash; became an activist against the war his son was committed to fighting.</p>
          <p>In New York, Paul Woolard, a vice president for Revlon, helped organize The Corporate Executives Committee for Peace, a group of 350 businessmen intent on pressuring politicians to pull out of Vietnam.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;At least my stepfather understood that it was the policy he opposed, not the soldier,&rdquo; Woolard said. &ldquo;There was no friction between us. I told him, &lsquo;You can do what you want to do, but I&rsquo;m a SEAL, and I believe in my teammates and what we&rsquo;re doing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
          <p>In January 1970, Woolard&rsquo;s best friend &ndash; and right-hand man in Vietnam &ndash; was killed by enemy fire. Woolard carried on. Under rocket fire in April &ndash; just before he wrapped up his second tour &ndash; he dived into a river to rescue women and children whose boat had capsized during an ambush.</p>
          <p>The month after Woolard got home, Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire on a protest at Kent State University, killing four students and wounding nine.</p>

          <p>Ciesielski went on protesting the war until it was over &ndash; moving to Philadelphia to work for an organization that assisted conscientious objectors, marching, getting tear-gassed and prodded with rifle butts.</p>
          <p>Today, Woolard heads up a fund for the families of those killed while serving in special operations units. Ciesielski volunteers at a free health clinic he helped found.</p>
          <p>Both men are still married to the women they met during the war. Both have children who are proud of their fathers' pasts, though some of Ciesielski&rsquo;s relatives took a while to come around. Cousins who&rsquo;d served in the military stayed angry with him for a long time.</p>
					<p>Would he do it all again?</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I would hope so,&rdquo; he says.</p>
          <p>Time hasn&rsquo;t changed Ciesielski&rsquo;s mind on the war, but it has changed Woolard&rsquo;s &ndash; mostly because of the way it ended. Vietnam is a communist country today.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;And here, in America, it did horrible things,&rdquo; Woolard says. &ldquo;It created a lasting divide. There are 58,000 names on the Vietnam Wall &ndash; and I know a few of them.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He forgave yesterday&rsquo;s peaceniks long ago. He&rsquo;s inclined to hold a grudge against someone like Ciesielski.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in the military, you don&rsquo;t get to pick your war,&rdquo; Woolard says. &ldquo;My sympathy for him would have been limited then, and it&rsquo;s limited now.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He softens when he hears about Ciesielski&rsquo;s prison time. At least he didn&rsquo;t desert, Woolard says, or run off to Canada with the draft dodgers.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;He took his licks,&rdquo; Woolard says quietly.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done. We&rsquo;re square.&rdquo;</p>
