					<h3>Louise Mulligan wanted her husband back. Simple as that.</p>
					<p>Everyone else could keep arguing about Vietnam. Should America have gotten into the war? And now, as the 1970s dawned, how should we get out?</p>

          <p>Louise just wanted her family whole again. For her children - six boys - to have their father.</p>
          <p>Jim Mulligan, a Navy pilot, had been shot down March 20, 1966, during his 80th combat mission over North Vietnam. His plane was leading a flight of bombers sent to take out a bridge. Ground fire found his Skyhawk and sent it into a spin. Mulligan bailed out. His wingman spotted the white bloom of his chute, then Mulligan lying motionless on the green earth below, the enemy closing in like ants on a prize.</p>
          <p>Louise wouldn't know whether she was a widow or still a wife until months later, when the North Vietnamese announced her husband's capture over Radio Hanoi and released a photo of him.</p>
			 		<p>For the next three years, Louise obeyed government orders to keep quiet. She and other POW families were told publicity could endanger the prisoners.</p>
					<p>"I was told not to speak to anybody about it," she said. "Nobody except family really knew."</p>
					<p>The number of men being held was anything but clear - from 500 to triple that. War can claim the lives of men whose bodies are never recovered, and the North Vietnamese felt no obligation to supply a complete roster of its captives.</p>

					<h3>SPOTIFY<br>Sounds of 1971-1975</h3>
					<p class="captions"> <span class="text-muted">In the anti-establishment early 1970s, even hit-machine Motown develops a social conscience. The Vietnam War finally ends, and artists turn their focus to "the nightmare of readjustment." But the anger of a country hungover from the 1960s is fading. Fatigue sets in. Disco is coming. As you read, listen to some of the songs that shaped 1971-75.</span></p>

					<p>But with each turn of the calendar's page, she grew more desperate. Her husband's captors allowed him to write home three or four times a year - letters that seemed to appear magically at the family's home in Virginia Beach. Letters that were increasingly short, obviously censored, and clearly months old by the time she received them.</p>
					<p>Mulligan was being held in Hanoi - first, at the place prisoners referred to as the Hanoi Hilton, then on to ever-worsening conditions as his captors ran out of patience.</p>
					<p>A senior officer, Mulligan was one of the leaders of prisoner resistance. The North Vietnamese knew the war was unpopular in America, and they wanted high-ranking prisoners to give statements against it.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			 <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
					<p>Mulligan was among those who refused. He and 10 others - three of them were from Hampton Roads - were singled out for more than the usual interrogation and beatings.</p>
					<p>They were sent to tiny, squalid cells - in a place they called Alcatraz - for solitary confinement and systematic torture. They were tied, shackled or forced to stand in excruciating positions for hours, sometimes days. Hung by ropes that pulled their shoulders out of socket. Given little water, food or medical care.</p>
					<p>Louise didn't know all her husband was going through, but she knew it was bad - and probably getting worse as the war dragged on. There's only so much comfort in a months-old letter. She had to do something. Peace talks had been going on since 1968, but negotiations always fell apart.</p>
          <p>She and another POW wife from California decided to organize women like themselves - some whose husbands were known prisoners, others living with the dreadful silence that follows the words "missing in action."</p>
          <p>Together, they lobbied behind the scenes, badgering U.S. politicians and diplomats, writing letters to humanitarian organizations and the North Vietnamese government.</p>
          <p>When none of it worked, the wives grew &ldquo;very tired of being quiet,&rdquo; Louise said. &ldquo;These were our husbands. The fathers of our children. We were angry. And when you make a bunch of women angry &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Louise was the first to go public. &ldquo;I talked to my children about it first. Some of our sons were in high school by then, and I knew we&rsquo;d be in a fish bowl after that.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>In August 1970, a photo of a grim-faced Louise appeared in The Virginian-Pilot with an article announcing the formation of The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. There would be billboard campaigns, pressure during elections, a national speakers&rsquo; bureau, delegations sent to the peace talks as haunting, high-heeled reminders.</p>
          <p>Such boldness from married women was practically unheard of at the time. &ldquo;Wives couldn&rsquo;t even get credit cards in their own names,&rdquo; Louise said. &ldquo;Some of our gals just absolutely could not bring themselves to go out in public and do the things we needed to do. And that was OK. There were plenty of other things they could do.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>The wives caught the nation&rsquo;s eye. The New York Times sent a reporter to Virginia Beach, a city with perhaps the highest concentration of POW wives. The story described the women as &ldquo;slender, gracious and attractive.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Americans started paying attention, rallying around the one thing in the war they could all agree upon: The prisoners must be brought home.</p>
          <p>Volunteers stepped up to help with mailing campaigns. Donations came in. The mayors of Norfolk and Virginia Beach traveled to Paris to personally plead with a North Vietnamese diplomat to release their residents.</p>
          <p>Evelyn Grubb, an Air Force wife from Petersburg, came up with the black POW-MIA flag that became an enduring symbol of the cause. She worked tirelessly on behalf of the group, with no idea her husband had died soon after capture.</p>
          <p>Louis remembers a time it went the other way. &ldquo;There was one woman whose husband had been declared killed-in-action. Three years later, she walked out to the mailbox and found a letter from him. How cruel it was of the North Vietnamese not to release the names of prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Johanna Heimerl, a Navy officer who specialized in personnel, was sent to assist at the naval hospital in Portsmouth, where the entire 13th floor was set aside for the prisoners. They arrived in three waves for weeks of medical care, debriefing and readjustment. Movies, newspapers and magazines were brought in to help them catch up on all they&rsquo;d missed.</p>
					<p>Heimerl&rsquo;s job: handle the onslaught of reporters, field the flood of cards, flowers, gifts and invites to dinners and ball games, keep track of the POW bracelets that poured in. Six million bracelets had been sold, worn faithfully by strangers to show their support. Many were now mailed to the hospital, with notes that each bracelet be given to man whose name it bore.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;We worked 24/7,&rdquo; Heimerl said. &ldquo;The phones rang all night long. But none of us minded. No one was ever late to work or left early. We were welcoming home heroes.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Once, she was allowed to go to the airport to meet an arriving flight. &ldquo;I still get chills thinking about it. All these people were there, waving flags, singing God Bless America. I rode in one of the escort vehicles back to the hospital. People were lining the streets. Standing at attention. Saluting. It seemed like everyone was finally unified. I was in the back seat, crying my eyes out.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Louise Mulligan was too ecstatic to shed tears. Her husband was gaunt but &ldquo;was upright and had all his faculties. And that&rsquo;s all we needed. We were so afraid our men would be left behind.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Relief in one country.</p>
					<p>Terror in the other.</p>

					<h3>Reality caught up with Ngoc Cam Tran the morning of April 29, 1975, when his mother woke him and told him to pack a bag.</h3>
					<p>He&rsquo;d been born into conflict.</p>
          <p>When Tran was 7, during the Tet Offensive of 1968, he&rsquo;d hidden under a bed as bombs exploded around Saigon. He&rsquo;d seen bodies stacked in the streets outside his home.</p>
          <p>A few times while walking to school in the years that followed, Tran saw Buddhist monks light themselves on fire &ndash; a demonstration against religious persecution by the American-backed government.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">  
          <p>But Tran was just a kid. Like other boys in his neighborhood, he spent most of his time studying, playing outside with friends, squabbling with siblings.</p>
          <p>He knew nothing of the Paris Peace Accords, which only paused the fighting. He&rsquo;d never heard of any prisoners of war. Didn&rsquo;t realize American soldiers had left. Had no idea South Vietnam &ndash; his home &ndash; was about to collapse.</p>
          <p>On that morning, 13-year-old Tran and his family walked to the U.S. Embassy. Thousands of panicked South Vietnamese had gathered outside the building&rsquo;s walls, aware that tanks from North Vietnam were closing in. The Americans had promised to evacuate citizens who&rsquo;d worked with them &ndash; as many as they could, at least.</p>
					<p>Tran&rsquo;s mother, a slight woman who earned a living selling soup on the street, pushed through the crowd, flashed some documents at the gate then signaled to her four children to follow her inside. Tran still doesn&rsquo;t know how she obtained the paperwork.</p>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
          <p>Inside the compound, piles of documents burned. Furniture was scattered on the lawn. People jockeyed for space near the concrete slab where, every few minutes, a Marine helicopter landed, filled up and lifted off.</p>
					<p>Hours passed. At some point, Tran&rsquo;s 16-year-old sister left to retrieve something from home. She hadn&rsquo;t returned when his family reached the front of the line that evening.</p>
          <p>Tran, the oldest boy, carried his siblings&rsquo; bags. His mother and two younger brothers ran aboard the helicopter first. Before he could follow, a Marine put out his arm.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s full!&rdquo; he must have said.</p>
          <p>Tran didn&rsquo;t understand. He didn&rsquo;t speak English. He was too disoriented to realize the significance of what was happening. Too scared to protest.</p>
          <p>He stood there, clutching his family&rsquo;s luggage, and silently watched the helicopter fly away.</p>

					<h3>Desperation swept South Vietnam.</h3>
          <p>Only about 5,000 people were airlifted from the U.S. Embassy. Thousands more, fearing what would happen once the communists took over, found other ways to escape.</p>
          <p>Many crammed aboard small boats and sailed out to sea, searching for space aboard U.S. Navy ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. Others commandeered helicopters left behind by the U.S. military, scooped up their families and flew out over the water.</p>
          <p>No real plan. Only hope.</p>
          <p>J.W. Washington couldn&rsquo;t believe the radio traffic he was hearing aboard the command ship Blue Ridge. Marine pilots flying evacuation missions were reporting dozens of South Vietnamese helicopters buzzing through their airspace. Soon, a few of those rogue pilots were radioing the ship, asking for permission to land.</p>
          <p>This hadn&rsquo;t been part of the mission.</p>
          <p>Washington headed to the flight deck to see the madness firsthand. A South Vietnamese helicopter had just landed. The ship had room for the refugees, but not the aircraft that brought them aboard.</p>
          <p>He pulled out a camera and snapped a photo of what would become an iconic scene &ndash; a telling symbol of America&rsquo;s involvement in Vietnam: The flight crew pushed the multi-million dollar helicopter to the edge of the deck, then flipped it into the sea.</p>

          <p>Washington, a Marine, had served two tours on the ground in Vietnam. He knew men who&rsquo;d been wounded and some who had been killed.</p>
          <p><em>All of that ... for this,</em> he thought.</p>
          <p>On another ship, not far away, Ngoc Cam Tran was vomiting. He had made it onto the next helicopter after watching his family fly away from the embassy. It took him to an amphibious assault ship, where hundreds of refugees crowded into cargo space.</p>
					<p>He&rsquo;d never been to sea before. The boy wanted to ask for help finding his people, but he was too seasick to speak.</p>
          <p>His family was one of many that had been separated.</p>
          <p>In the final hours before North Vietnamese soldiers seized control of Saigon, more than 10,000 South Vietnamese fled. Many thousands more would escape by boat in the months and years that followed.</p>
          <p>A nation made one again. Families ripped apart.</p>
          <p>Once his stomach settled, Tran started searching. First in the Philippines, where the warship unloaded its passengers. Then at a camp in Guam, where the first wave of refugees spent weeks awaiting resettlement in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Tran marked his 14th birthday there.</p>
          <p>Weeks later, he was told he&rsquo;d be flying to California. He&rsquo;d begin a new life, the officials said. With luck, he&rsquo;d find a new family.</p>
          <p>He was staring out a bus window, riding to meet his plane on the tarmac, when he saw them.</p>
          <p>Tran stood and shouted for the driver to stop, then leaped off the bus, yelling for his mother.</p>
          <p>She ran to meet him, wrapping him in her arms and crying.</p>
          <p>Their plane tickets were to somewhere in Arkansas, she explained. Is that near California? Thank God they had found one another before they left &ndash; just in time to change Tran&rsquo;s flight.</p>
          <p>The joyous reunion was cut short by a hopeful question:</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Have you seen your sister?&rdquo;</p>
