					<p>Perkins, an 18-year-old Marine, had just landed at Khe Sanh, a combat base near the &ldquo;demilitarized zone&rdquo; &ndash; or DMZ, as the line drawn between North and South Vietnam was called.</p>
          <p>It was Jan. 19, 1968, just days before the start of the Tet Offensive and some of the worst fighting of the war. The North Vietnamese army had Khe Sanh in its cross hairs, softening it up with mortar shells before the communists&rsquo; first all-out campaign to take the country.</p>
          <p>Perkins didn&rsquo;t make it 36 hours before a bullet made one thing clear: The enemy wasn&rsquo;t the only danger.</p>
          <p>His first day on base was a long one &ndash; most of it spent digging foxholes. Intelligence was sketchy, but Khe Sanh was bracing for a major assault. &ldquo;We knew they were coming,&rdquo; Perkins said.</p>
          <p>Exhausted, he headed for a tent, where he bedded down on the floor: &ldquo;There weren&rsquo;t enough cots, and I was the new guy. But it was OK. I remember going to sleep, listening to 'The Lone Ranger' on the Armed Forces radio station and thinking, &lsquo;This isn&rsquo;t so bad. In a tent, with a bunch of guys.&rsquo; It was really pretty cool.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He was jolted awake by a hail of mortar fire exploding nearby. &ldquo;I watched a bunch of feet jump over my head,&rdquo; Perkins said, &ldquo;and when I thought the last pair had gone by, I sat up. But there was a fellow on a cot behind me. When he jumped up, he had his rifle across his chest.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>It fired. The bullet drove into the back of Perkin&rsquo;s head &ndash; low and to the left &ndash; then came out the front, taking much of his lower jaw with it.</p>
			 		<p>&ldquo;I got up off the ground, turned around and looked at him. Nobody else was around. Neither of us said anything. I think we were both in shock. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure what had happened.&rdquo;</p>

He spent many of the following years working with Operation Smile, based in Virginia Beach. Behind him, a photo from the '80s shows one of his many reconstructive surgeries. (Stephen M.

					<p>He came to on the Repose, a hospital ship that had done duty in Korea. In Vietnam, its staff would treat 9,000 battle casualties, earning the ship its nickname: Angel of the Orient.</p>
          <p>Medicine makes big advancements during war. Wounds like Perkins&rsquo; provide an extreme form of practice. He was facing a string of surgeries and bone grafts and a 16-month stay at the naval hospital in Portsmouth. He&rsquo;d have to learn to eat and talk again. Come to grips with the fake beard and moustache provided by the Marine Corps. Ultimately shed them as he accepted the scars. The stares.</p>
          <p>He still felt lucky: &ldquo;I felt that way almost immediately. I&rsquo;d made it out alive.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>As for the Marine who shot him, Perkins was told he had turned himself in, certain he&rsquo;d killed somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard they sent him to the naval hospital in Philadelphia,&rdquo; Perkins said, &ldquo;to the psych ward.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Weary of U.S. bombing in the north, tired of the stalemate in the south, the enemy spent months secretly plotting the Tet Offensive &ndash; a combination of major conventional assaults and guerilla operations.</p>
          <p>It was the largest coordinated campaign either side had attempted so far, with hundreds of thousands of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong striking deep into South Vietnam, attacking military targets and a multitude of towns and cities.</p>
          <p>Surprised U.S. and South Vietnamese forces temporarily lost control of a number of places. Assaults came in waves. Khe Sanh, where Perkins was accidentally shot, was under siege for 77 days. The Americans lost more than 500 lives; the North Vietnamese up to 15,000 &ndash; most from the carpet bombing done to defend the base.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Search&rdquo; often meant motoring up an ever-narrowing tidal river, announced by the rumble of the boat&rsquo;s twin engines, waiting to be ambushed by Viet Cong hidden in the thick vegetation that shrouded the banks. The return down the river was even more perilous.</p>

Pursuit sometimes turned into a footrace. Larkin was grateful if the tangle of undergrowth had been withered by a recent spraying of Agent Orange.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d see the planes going over, and we were grateful because it meant we&rsquo;d be able to see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At the time, nobody realized that stuff was dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing down because it&rsquo;s raining so hard you can&rsquo;t see anything, but you know you still have troops in combat out there,&rdquo; Johnson said, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do for them.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Downtime was killed on the base, where alcohol flowed freely.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;There was a lot of hard liquor,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d play cards, roll ourselves into bed and hope to get back up there tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Johnson was a native of Newport News, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute. He wound up stationed at Dong Ha, South Vietnam&rsquo;s northernmost city. He was 24 and married just six weeks.</p>

          <p>Most recon flights stuck to an altitude of 1,000 feet, just above the reach of accurate small-arms fire. Lucky shots still riddled his Bird Dog. One shattered its window, leaving him peppered with shrapnel and covered in blood. And then there was a close call with a surface-to-air missile &ndash; a silver streak he&rsquo;d barely gotten off his tail before it exploded.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We had many a pucker night,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>To mark targets, they had to dip into even more hazardous airspace, dropping to about 800 feet, so Johnson could squeeze off a rocket that ignited into a white phosphorus plume.</p>

					<h3>Marshall Lefavor, a Navy brat from Norfolk, discovered the enemy&rsquo;s dedication at Hill 55. Near Da Nang, the hill was named &ndash; in military fashion &ndash; for its elevation above sea level.</h3>
          <p>Lefavor, a graduate of Princess Anne High School, had joined the Marines after college.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We had about 350 people in my officers&rsquo; class at Quantico,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we were all sent to Vietnam. Every last one of us.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The escalating war was bringing a flood of U.S. troops. Lefavor waited for two weeks in Okinawa, Japan, for transport: &ldquo;Back then, they had a saying: There&rsquo;s only two kinds of Marines that aren&rsquo;t in Nam &ndash; ones on the way there and ones on the way back.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He&rsquo;d trained to be a backseater, a position he&rsquo;d fill in a variety of aircraft during the last half of his 13-month tour. The first half was spent in the red dirt and plywood hooches of Hill 55, where two Marine commands were headquartered.</p>

          <p>There, Lefavor became a &ldquo;keeper of the BBs,&rdquo; the middle-man on the radio linking troops in the field with aerial, naval or artillery firepower.</p>
          <p>Most of his shifts were spent in an underground bunker.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Thirteen issues of Playboy, two Bob Hope shows, 58 malaria pills &ndash; that&rsquo;s how we told time, how long we&rsquo;d been in country,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>Tet erupted approximately one Playboy issue into his tour. &ldquo;They wanted Da Nang, and we were in their way. They surprised us. Hill 55 took everything Tet had to offer.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>The enemy&rsquo;s single-minded ferocity stunned Lefavor. They usually attacked at night, storming headlong through the mine field ringing the camp, throwing themselves at its barbed-wire perimeter.</p>
          <p>The defenders leveled their artillery tubes, firing right into the advancing soldiers, who wore short ropes around an ankle, hoping that if they died, a comrade would be able to drag their bodies from the field.</p>

          <p>Corpsmen would leave bags of blood plasma outside the perimeter, knowing the enemy had little to no medical supplies.</p>
          <p>It wasn&rsquo;t a humanitarian gesture.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d spike them with rat poison,&rdquo; Lefavor said. &ldquo;War is ugly on all sides.&rdquo;</p>
