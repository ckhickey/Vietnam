  				<h3>In the spring of 1964, half of all Americans had never heard of Vietnam. Those who had wrote it as two words: Viet Nam. It’s unclear exactly when it morphed into one.</h3>
					<p>Back then, the sun had just set on the &ldquo;Happy Days&rdquo; era &ndash; the 1950s &ndash; which despite our nostalgia, wasn&rsquo;t all peace and poodle skirts. For three of those years, we were entangled in Korea, a chess match played to a draw against some of the same forces we&rsquo;d deal with in Vietnam: China and the Soviet Union.</p>
					<p>Communism, and the threat of its spread, was the enemy of the day &ndash; the Red Scare that sent school kids scurrying under desks during atomic bomb drills.</p>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
					<p>By the early ’60s, that menace had reached as close as Cuba, where Soviet-placed nuclear missiles were poised to fire at the U.S.</p>
					<p>On the homefront, upheaval: Race riots. A president assassinated. A younger generation brewing rebellion.</p>
					<p>Against that backdrop, ­Master Sgt. William Leroy Siegrist boarded a plane bound for Vietnam, where a civil war was heating up and the Chinese and Soviets were backing the communist north.</p>
					<p>Siegrist was born and raised in Norfolk – a boy who stalked butterflies with a BB gun in the family’s yard in Berkley. His father had been a soldier. His older brother fought with the Navy in World War II. Siegrist joined the Army as soon as he could, at 17, becoming a paratrooper and, eventually, a member of its Special Forces, the newly minted Green Berets.</p>

					<p>By the time he received orders for Vietnam, Siegrist had already been dispatched to outposts around the globe. He was 34, married, with three sons.</p>
					<p>His father, George, quoted in yellowed newspaper clippings, said his son had a bad feeling about this latest assignment. They had Thanksgiving dinner together a few days before his departure.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Pop, this is it,&rdquo; George Siegrist recalled his son saying. &ldquo;Take care of my boys.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Siegrist reached Vietnam on Dec. 5, 1964, taking his place among a growing number of U.S. advisers who were quietly coaching the South Vietnamese military.</p>
					<p>Officially, America had yet to put “boots on the ground.”</p>

					<p>But even in the military heartland, “Nam” stands alone &ndash; the most unpopular war of the 20th century, waged during one of the nation’s most divisive times.</p>
					<p>Protestors tried to block the Navy in our harbor. One movement took aim at military wives, pressuring them not to throw parties for returning husbands. Sailors were sent to prison for trying to sabotage their own ship.</p>
					<p>Decades later, these vets can still smell the napalm, still hear the thump of a Huey’s rotors and still feel the snubbing too many got back home.</p>
					<p>In a veterans hall in Virginia Beach, they demonstrate daily, in a very personal manner, that they haven’t forgotten. Photos of actress Jane Fonda, referred to as “Hanoi Jane” for her over-the-top anti-war activities, are glued inside the urinals as targets.</p>
					<p>Outside the comfort of each other’s company, many have spent a long time lying low &ndash; a tactic they’ve mastered. Charlie, as they called their enemy, often hid in plain sight. No one ever called the celebrated vets of World War II “baby killers.” Or advised them not to invite trouble by wearing their uniforms off base.</p>

					<h3>From one side of the globe to the other, time zones can blur the calendar. Accounts of the Battle of Dong So say it raged somewhere across Dec. 30-31, 1964 – less than one month after Siegrist landed in country.</h3>
					<p>According to the citation that accompanied his Silver Star, awarded posthumously by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Siegrist was acting as senior adviser to a South Vietnamese task force conducting night road-clearing operations about 40 miles north of Saigon. Outside a small town on the edge of an old rubber plantation, his task force of a few hundred men stopped to rest, setting up a perimeter. Siegrist was one of a handful of Americans along for the mission.</p>
					<p>In the dark, two battalions of Viet Cong attacked, outnumbering the task force&rsquo;s men by at least 4 to 1. When the South Vietnamese commander was killed, Siegrist exposed himself to enemy fire so he could radio for help.</p>
					<p>In what must have been an act of complete desperation, he called in artillery strikes on the task force’s position. A 105 mm howitzer began to boom in the distance, raining down hundreds of 30-inch “beehive” shells, each exploding into thousands of small darts.</p>
					<p>The Viet Cong got to him first. Siegrist died in hand-to-hand combat, a blizzard of shrapnel all around.</p>
					<p>The day after the telegram arrived in Norfolk, a photo of his grieving parents appeared in the local newspaper.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>For so many others, that road was just beginning.</p>
					<p>In time, thanks to TV, Vietnam would become the first war Americans could watch from their living rooms – sweat, fatigues, bombs, screaming peaceniks – all imported on the nightly news.</p>
					<p>And William Siegrist’s name would be carved into the first panel of a long, black-granite memorial wall in Washington.</p>
					<p>But as 1964 came to a close, few had an inkling of what we were in for, how long it would take to get out, or how another nation’s civil war would tear our own country apart.</p>
					<p>Bill Siegrist only knew his dad wasn't coming home.</p>

					<h3>Bill, the oldest of the Siegrist boys, was named after his father. Most everyone is gone now. His two younger brothers. His mother. And of course, his father.</h3>
					<p>He recalls his mother refusing to open the door for the Western Union man that day. She knew what his knock meant.</p>
					<p>Ever since, Bill has worked hard to hold on to the memories of a father who’d been away nearly as much as he’d been around.</p>
					<p>“But when he was here, he was just Dad,” Bill says. “We didn’t see him very often in his battle gear.”</p>
					<p>Bill’s voice still cracks under the weight of a 50-year-old loss. Long pauses punctuate his summary of life after the telegram – how his mother struggled to raise him and his younger brothers, eventually remarrying only to be widowed again, and again.</p>
					<p>“Growing up without my father was pretty rough,” he says. “I probably gave my mother a very hard time – much more than I should have.”</p>
          <p>The war went on so long, Bill grew old enough to fight in it himself. His draft number was never called.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I was glad,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go. Many of my friends had to, and it continuously got more horrific.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>He has always considered his father a hero, but “in my opinion, we shouldn’t have been there. We were trying to stop something that was inevitable in that country.”</p>
          <p>Bill stuck to civilian life, describing himself as a jack-of-all-trades, and raised a family of his own. He’s moved around a bit, always careful to take along precious cargo: His father’s green jacket and beret; the flag from his funeral, pinned with medals; a gold ring Bill has been wearing for years.</p>

					<p>The letters arrived three months ago, a voice from the grave after five decades of silence. They’d surfaced at a garage sale in Texas, discovered by a stranger who collects war memorabilia. After reading them, the man tracked down the Siegrist family.</p>
					<p>They weren’t written by Bill’s father but by an officer from Pennsylvania who was serving with him in Vietnam. Addressed to the officer’s wife, they were penned on the same kind of paper Bill’s father had used to write home.</p>
          <p>Bill leafed through the letters, filled with intimate and mundane exchanges between a couple he’d never met. Suddenly, words leaped off the page.</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-12">
							<img src="Vietnam_Image1.jpg" width="100%">

					</div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Then, in a second letter:</p>
          <div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-12">
							<img src="Vietnam_Image2.jpg" width="100%">
						</div>
					</div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>The officer wrote about choppering to the scene the next morning and seeing bodies all over the village. He described finding two in particular – Siegrist was one of two Americans killed that night – and spending the entire day flying out the dead and wounded.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I shall spare you the gory details of it, but you can imagine what all those Viet Cong could do to about 250 people ... I am really sick at heart.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Bill reads those excerpts over the phone to a reporter. When he gets to a third letter, he starts to break down:</p>
          <div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-12">
							<img src="Vietnam_Image3.jpg" width="100%">
						</div>
					</div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Bill takes an extra long pause.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;... on the last contact we had with him. His last call &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Bill is crying again. He takes a deep breath. Chokes out the last words the officer heard his father say.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good God! &hellip; We need 300 rounds of artillery on the town now. &hellip; They are pouring through the gates!&rsquo;&thinsp;&ldquo;</p>
          <p>Bill has read the letters to himself at least a dozen times now: “I always knew what happened to him – it’s in the awards citation – but to hear it. To have somebody who was actually there tell you.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;It opens up the heart once again.&rdquo;</p>
