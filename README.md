# Vietnam
This is the master code for Echoes from the Jungle, a multi-part series on the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War from The Virginian-Pilot. This project was created using bootstrap, the Spotify API, animate.css and font-awesome.

The meat and potatoes of this project is parts 1-7.html and .css. The homepage is under index.html, and my video project, Memories of Vietnam, is under video.html.
