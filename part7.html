					<p>Theirs is a classic American tale: A group of immigrants leaves a country in turmoil, searching for a better life. The first generation works difficult, low-paying jobs. Their children pick up the language, go to public school and learn a trade or join the military. Most of their children&rsquo;s children &ndash; the first non-refugee generation &ndash; will probably graduate from college.</p>
          <p>Tuan was 12 when his family fled to America.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;When I look back on that time now, I am thankful for what happened,&rdquo; said Tuan, a U.S. Navy commander who plans to retire later this year after serving more than 25 years. &ldquo;It was a terrible thing for Vietnam, a terrible tragedy for many, many people, but we are so fortunate. That was the beginning of our path to freedom.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>This year &ndash; 40 years since the war ended, and 20 years since the U.S. re-established diplomatic relations with Vietnam &ndash; millions of Vietnamese are reflecting on their dramatic journey and their place in America.</p>
          <p>Their stories have much in common. They arrived here by the thousands. Few spoke English. Many were separated from loved ones. Some still haven&rsquo;t reconnected.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;But we found a way,&rdquo; Tuan said. &ldquo;We, as a people, have made a place for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He returned to Vietnam this spring with 10 other Vietnamese Americans, including his wife and sister, hoping to trace their story back to its beginning.</p>

					<h3>Tuan recalls vividly the day the Vietnam War ended. He was 9, visiting his grandmother in the countryside. He remembers watching a tank roll slowly over a bridge, heading for Saigon.</h3>
					<p>His siblings were at home in the city with his mother, where they hid under the stairs as gunfire rang out. An announcement came over the TV: the communists had taken the capital.</p>
          <p>At a military base across town, their father, an officer in the South Vietnam army, tore off his uniform and walked home in his underwear as North Vietnamese soldiers paraded through the city.</p>
          <p>Days later, he was among those ordered to report to a re-education camp. Just 10 days out in the countryside, he was told, part of a new citizenship requirement. He went without struggle. Weeks passed before the children realized their father wouldn&rsquo;t be returning anytime soon &ndash; if ever.</p>
          <p>Their city &ndash; renamed Ho Chi Minh City by the victors, for the former North Vietnam president &ndash; became a police state. Travel was restricted. Businesses were seized. Food was rationed. Residents were forced to register with the government, and anyone under 18 had to join a club known as the &ldquo;Good Nieces and Nephews of Uncle Ho,&rdquo; which taught communist propaganda and encouraged boys and girls to report their parents if they overheard plans to undermine the government.</p>
          <p>One day, soldiers came to the house and confiscated all of the family&rsquo;s books and magazines. Tuan handed over his &ldquo;Adventures of Tintin&rdquo; comic books, he recalls, believing the men when they said it was for the good of the country.</p>
          <p>They were just kids. They didn&rsquo;t understand the consequences of being on the wrong side when a war ends. They also didn&rsquo;t know their mother had been quietly making plans to find their father &ndash; and to get away.</p>

					<h3>Hampton Roads wasn&rsquo;t one of the designated relocation hubs &ndash; like Philadelphia and Houston &ndash; for the more than half-million Vietnamese who fled to the United States in the two decades after the war. But for various reasons, about 6,000 Vietnamese live here, a relatively small and close-knit community.</h3>
					<p>Once a week, many gather at special Catholic church services in Norfolk and Hampton, where Mass is said in Vietnamese. Some meet regularly as part of the Vietnamese Community of Hampton Roads, an organization started to unite the population. One of the group&rsquo;s favorite meeting spots is Pho 79, where bilingual servers dish out traditional Vietnamese soups.</p>
          <p>Most of the time, though, the Vietnamese community blends with the general population here &ndash; a good sign for a group only one generation removed from refugee status. Tuan&rsquo;s two adult sons are studying accounting at Old Dominion University.</p>
          <p>Another common characteristic of immigrants: Family is a big deal. Nearly all of Tuan&rsquo;s extended family members have moved to Virginia Beach to be near him.</p>
          <p>A half-dozen Vietnamese families got together recently for a dinner party at his house in Virginia Beach. The adults sat around a table, drinking Coronas and swapping stories about how they got to America.</p>
          <p>Their journeys have led them down different paths: One of the guests runs a nail salon, one of the first industries to offer decent jobs and training to women who escaped Vietnam. Another was a naval architect. There was a stay-at-home mom, an engineer, an administrative assistant. Tuan, like many others, is here because he joined the military, hoping to give back to the country he credits with saving him.</p>
          <p>But like most of the Vietnamese families living here, they share a common bond, one rarely discussed with neighbors and co-workers: Their incredible stories of escape and survival.</p>

					<h3>A few days into his return to Vietnam this spring, Tuan offered a confession: He didn&rsquo;t tell his father, back in Virginia Beach, about the trip.</h3>
					<p>&ldquo;Literally, he told me he would disown me if I came back here,&rdquo; Tuan said while riding in a van through the city of his childhood, which he and many others still defiantly refer to as Saigon. &ldquo;Part of the problem is, in Vietnamese, the translation of forgive also means to forget. My parents&rsquo; generation does not want to forget.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Tuan believes Vietnamese emigrants should do whatever they can to help those still struggling under communist rule. Vietnamese Americans should go back and see how their home nation still struggles with widespread poverty and human rights abuses.</p>
          <p>But he understands why his parents would rather keep their distance.</p>
          <p>Tuan&rsquo;s father spent almost three years in a prison camp after the war before Tuan&rsquo;s mother paid a bribe to have him released. He could count himself among the lucky ones: More than 165,000 others didn&rsquo;t survive the re-education camps, mostly dying from starvation and disease.</p>
          <p>Once his father&rsquo;s freedom had been bought, Tuan&rsquo;s family had no choice but to flee the country. Fearing what would happen to the children if the parents were detained together, his mother and father made a difficult choice to split the family.</p>
          <p>Tuan, the oldest boy, and Van, his eldest sister, would leave first with their father; the others would follow sometime later. Because Tuan was not yet a teenager, the cost to smuggle him onto an overcrowded fishing boat was 5 ounces of gold &ndash; half the price demanded of adults.</p>
          <p>Nearly 60 people crammed onto a boat and sailed into the choppy South China Sea. It&rsquo;s a familiar story: In 1978 and &rsquo;79, tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees fled by boat. Those who survived often landed on the shores of several island nations in Southeast Asia, where international aid groups set up refugee camps.</p>
          <p>After four days at sea, Tuan&rsquo;s boat was picked up by a rusted vessel operated by a Christian relief organization. They were taken to a refugee camp in Malaysia, where they spent six months before a family in Buffalo, N.Y, sponsored them to come to the U.S.</p>
          <p>In Buffalo, Tuan&rsquo;s father was offered a job as a janitor at a prestigious private school. The family lived in a suite inside the school, and at night, Tuan and his sister helped their father clean.</p>
          <p>One evening, while vacuuming the library, Tuan&rsquo;s sister picked up a copy of Life Magazine. The cover story that month &ndash; December 1978 &ndash; was about Prince Charles&rsquo; 30th birthday. Inside she found an article titled: &ldquo;Pariahs of the South China Sea.&rdquo; She called for Tuan and told him to come look.</p>
          <p>He couldn&rsquo;t read English, but he knew instantly what the story was about. The lead image showed dozens of wide-eyed refugees peering up from a crowded fishing boat &ndash; a class of people the American press had dubbed &ldquo;Boat People.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Tuan studied the picture for several seconds before recognizing his own face in the crowd. He was a literal poster child of the mass exodus from Vietnam.</p>
          <p>Back in Saigon, Tuan&rsquo;s two other sisters and his younger brother had no idea their father and siblings had left the country. They assumed they were hiding somewhere in the countryside. Better the children know nothing than risk them blabbing to a government official, their mother figured.</p>
          <p>Nearly a year passed before she acquired fake Chinese birth certificates for everyone and bought a boat ride out of the country. It took another several months &ndash; and a stroke of luck &ndash; to track down the rest of the family in Buffalo.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very fortunate,&rdquo; said Sandy Nguyen, the sister who traveled to Vietnam with Tuan. &ldquo;Lots of families were separated and still haven&rsquo;t found each other.&rdquo;</p>

					<h3>During their time in Vietnam, the group did the same touristy things most visitors to Saigon do: They took a boat tour on the Mekong Delta and posed for pictures with a python draped over their necks. They shopped for cheap souvenirs at the Ben Thanh Market and visited the site of the former U.S. embassy.</h3>

          <p>Every few minutes, it seemed &ndash; while standing near war monuments, while eating lunch, while crossing a busy street, anywhere, really &ndash; Tuan attached his smartphone to a selfie stick and made the entire group pose for photos. Within minutes, he&rsquo;d have them uploaded to Facebook.</p>
          <p>Tuan and the others joked often about the chaotic, seemingly lawless traffic &ndash; a jarring difference compared to the carefully planned suburbs of Virginia Beach.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Nearly 13 million people living in Saigon,&rdquo; Tuan quipped, &ldquo;and almost every one of them is on a motor bike.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>A few times, the group stopped for coffee at Starbucks &ndash; one of the few places offering anything other than the heavily sweetened and creamy coffee Vietnam is famous for.</p>
          <p>A strong French roast coffee: a taste of home for Tuan and his friends.</p>
          <p>At dinner one night in Ho Chi Minh City, Tuan stood and held out a glass of banana wine:</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make a toast,&rdquo; he said, one of innumerable toasts during their three-week visit. &ldquo;To all of you who&rsquo;ve joined me on this adventure. &hellip; We&rsquo;ve come a long way together to visit our former home. We&rsquo;re so fortunate to have the opportunities that we have, and so fortunate to be able to return here now.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Among the other Vietnamese Americans who traveled with them, two tracked down and reunited with long-lost family members.</p>
          <p>Someday, Tuan said, they hope to bring them to America.</p>
